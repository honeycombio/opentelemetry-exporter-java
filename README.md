**NOTE**: Did you know that Honeycomb now supports OTLP ingest directly? This means you can use an [OTLP exporter](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/java-opentelemetry-getting-started/) and no longer need this exporter to send data to Honeycomb.

This repository contains OpenTelemetry plugins for interacting with Honeycomb using the [OpenTelemetry Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java).
